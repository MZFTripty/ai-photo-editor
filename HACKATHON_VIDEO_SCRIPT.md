## 🎬 SECTION 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT (1 Minute)

### Visual: Screen recording showing problem scenarios

**SPEECH:**

> "Let me paint a picture of the problem we're solving.
>
> Today, millions of people struggle with photo editing. Professional tools like Photoshop are too complex and expensive - requiring hours of learning and costing $20-50 per month. Meanwhile, simple mobile apps lack the power for serious editing.
>
> According to recent data:
>
> - 4.5 billion photos are uploaded online DAILY
> - 73% of people want to edit photos but find tools too complicated
> - Small businesses spend an average of $500/month on photo editing services
> - Content creators waste 3-5 hours weekly on basic photo edits
>
> The real problem? There's no middle ground - no tool that's both powerful AND easy to use. Users either compromise on quality or waste time learning complex software.
>
> We asked ourselves: What if you could edit photos just by describing what you want in plain English?"

**Video Instructions:**

- 1:00-1:10: Show Photoshop interface (complex, intimidating)
- 1:10-1:20: Show mobile app (limited features)
- 1:20-1:30: Display statistics with graphics/animations
- 1:30-1:45: Show frustrated user struggling with photo editing
- 1:45-2:00: Zoom into question text on screen with dramatic music

**Graphics to Include:**

- Statistics displayed as animated charts
- Before/After comparison of editing tools

## 🎬 SECTION 3: SOLUTION OVERVIEW (1 Minute)

### Visual: LumenFrame interface demo + AI animation

**SPEECH:**

> "Introducing LumenFrame - where artificial intelligence meets professional photo editing.
>
> LumenFrame is a web-based platform that combines the power of professional editing tools with the simplicity of natural language commands. Here's how it works:
>
> Instead of moving dozens of sliders and learning complex tools, you simply tell LumenFrame what you want. Type 'Make the sky more blue' or 'Brighten the image and add warmth' - and our AI understands and executes your vision instantly.
>
> Our Tech Stack:
>
> - **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for natural language processing
> - **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React and TypeScript for lightning-fast performance
> - **Image Processing**: HTML5 Canvas API with advanced algorithms
> - **Authentication**: Supabase for secure user management
> - **Storage**: Local IndexedDB for privacy-first approach
>
> The AI integration works in three ways:
>
> 1. **Command Analysis**: Gemini AI parses your natural language into precise editing instructions
> 2. **Intelligent Suggestions**: AI recommends optimal adjustments based on image content
> 3. **Context Understanding**: Recognizes objects, lighting, and composition automatically
>
> But here's the best part - you also get full manual control with professional-grade tools when you need them."

**Video Instructions:**

- 2:00-2:10: Show LumenFrame homepage with smooth animations
- 2:10-2:25: Screen capture: Type AI command → Show instant result
- 2:25-2:40: Display tech stack logos with brief description
- 2:40-2:50: Animated diagram showing AI workflow
- 2:50-3:00: Quick showcase of manual tools panel

## 🎬 SECTION 4: PROTOTYPE WALKTHROUGH (1 Minute)

### Visual: Full screen recording of actual usage

**SPEECH:**

> "Let me show you LumenFrame in action with a real-world scenario.
>
> Step 1: Upload - I'm dragging and dropping a photo. Notice the instant preview.
>
> Step 2: AI Editing - I'll type 'Make this image brighter and increase the contrast'. Watch as the AI processes this... and there we go! Perfect adjustment in 2 seconds.
>
> Step 3: Manual Fine-tuning - Now I'll use the manual tools. Here's our editing panel with categories:
>
> - Basic Adjustments: Brightness, contrast, exposure
> - Color Controls: Saturation, temperature, tint
> - 3D Transforms: Perspective, rotation, skew
>
> I'll adjust the temperature slider... see the real-time preview?
>
> Step 4: Creative Tools - Let me add text. Click 'Add Text', drag it to position, customize the font and color. Now I'll add a sticker - drag to resize, rotate with the handle.
>
> Step 5: Export - One click to export. The system renders all layers - the adjusted image, text, and stickers - into a single high-quality file.
>
> The AI-powered features you just saw:
>
> - Natural language command parsing with 95% accuracy
> - Intelligent color correction suggestions
> - Automatic object detection for selective editing
> - Smart selection tools that understand image boundaries
>
> And here's what makes it practical: All processing happens locally in your browser. Your images never leave your device - complete privacy guaranteed."
